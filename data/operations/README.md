The add* and rm* FASTA files represent simple modifications of the base.fasta layout of which can be found in base.svg or base_orig.svg. The base_orig file is the original visualization as generated by [VARNA](http://varna.lri.fr/), while base is the visualization obtained from Traveler by generating one of the modifications and then recrating the basic layout. Both SVG files can be used as a template. To obtain the layout for all the files, run:

```shell
for fn in `find . -name "*.fasta" -not -name "base*" `; do 
	PATH_TO_TRAVELER/traveler -gs ${fn} -ts --file-format varna base.svg base.fasta -a ${fn/.fasta}; 
done
```

The above shell code will generate SVG layouts for all the input files. If PDF version is needed, we recommend using the rsvg tool:

```shell
for fn in *.svg; do rsvg-convert -f pdf -o ${fn/.svg/.pdf}  ${fn}; done
```
