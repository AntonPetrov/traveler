Here you can find structures and layouts of 18S rRNA for species from the metazoa kingdom downloaded from the  [Comparative RNA Web (CRW) Site](http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu/). CRW is a repository storing visualizations of ribosomal RNAs in the form as used by the biological community. In order to lay out, for example, human rRNA using mouse rRNA as the template, run:

```shell
PATH_TO_TRAVELER\traveler \
    --target-structure human.fasta \
    --template-structure mous.ps mouse.fasta \
    --all human_from_mouse
```
The file experiments.zip contains results for all target-tempalte pairs from the directory. Please not, that these results were obtained with Traveler commit 7d8da9a11b794898390e4b57fd2014e2702b5f3f and might differ from layouts which you get with the most up-to-date version.
